# Bedtime Display
A simple heads-up-display for your bedroom ceiling

## Purpose
Waking up in the middle of the night and checking your phone not only makes you anxious about what notifications you may have missed, but also invades your pupiles with insomnia-inducing blue light. Once you're in the habit of reaching over to check your phone periodically throughout the night, you'll never stop.

Bedtime Display is a heads-up-display that mirrors your notifications, news, and updates that matter the most to you to your bedroom ceiling. This small tool stops the incessant phone checks you do throughout the night and produces a better night's rest.
